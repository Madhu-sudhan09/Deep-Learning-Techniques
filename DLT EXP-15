# Step 1: Load a pre-trained YOLO model (v8 nano - fast and small)
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

# Step 2: Load your image (you must have an image in the same folder)
img_path = '/content/IMG-20250523-WA0017.jpg'   # <-- replace this with your image filename

# Step 3: Perform object detection
results = model(img_path)

# Step 4: Display detected objects
# Iterate through the results list and show each result
for r in results:
    r.show()   # Opens a window with bounding boxes

# Step 5: Print detected class names in console
print("\nDetected Objects:")
for r in results:
